# Deep Learning Models from Scratch

This repo is used to implement some famous deep learning models from scratch so that I can:
* record my learning journey as an AI researcher
* try to come up with some new ideas from the details of the previous models
* share the code with everyone who want to learn the details of some (or all) deep learning models

## Roadmap
My current plan of implementations. 
I don't know how long it would take and it might change over time.

### NLP
* Transformers
* BERT
* ALBERT
* T5
* GPT
* Llama 3

### Computer Vision
* ResNet-50
* VGG-16
* YOLO
* Faster R-CNN
* Masked R-CNN
* GANs
* Diffusion Model

### Multimodal
* DALL-E
* CLIP
* Stable Diffusion
